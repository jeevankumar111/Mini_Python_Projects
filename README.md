# Grade Calculator App

A simple Python program that calculates a student’s final grade based on assignment scores and the weight of each assignment.

- Calculates weighted scores  
- Checks if total weight equals 100%  
- Outputs final grade rounded to two decimals  
- Assigns a letter grade (A–F)  
- Beginner-friendly and easy to modify  

## Skills Practiced
- Variables  
- Loops  
- User input
